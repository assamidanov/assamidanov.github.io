I am a postdoctoral scholar in health economics at UC Irvine's Joe C. Wen School of Population & Public Health, where my research focuses on how health policies impact access to care, health outcomes, and health equity. I use empirical methods to assess the effectiveness of policies in improving health access and reducing disparities, aiming to inform data-driven policy decisions that support underserved populations and enhance overall public health.

Currently, I lead several grant-funded projects. With support from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, I study the effect of Medicaid pregnancy dental benefits on care access for pregnant individuals and young children. Additionally, my work with the University of Wisconsin explores how paid sick leave policies affect disability participation. Another project, funded by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, examines hearing aid insurance mandates and their impact on usage. My analysis of telehealth policy expansion also sheds light on its influence on mental health access and suicide rates across states. <br>
