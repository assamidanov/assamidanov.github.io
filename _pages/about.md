I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Claremont Graduate University and concurrently serve as a Data Analyst Intern at Chime, a leader in the fintech sector. My academic research is focused on formulating methods to assess the impact of human discretion on algorithmic decision-making processes, specifically within the context of parole and probation settings.<br>
<br>
In addition, I am undertaking a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of technological tools within public sector organizations. These scholarly endeavors have equipped me with a nuanced understanding of both the challenges and opportunities inherent in the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to real-world scenarios.
