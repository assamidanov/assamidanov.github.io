I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in economics of crime, law and economics, and labor economics. I use experimental and quasi-experimental methods to explore the impact of public policies on parole and probation outcomes, aiming to improve societal well-being and policy efficacy.

My dedication to empirical research and policy analysis seeks to understand the effects of policy on societal and economic dynamics.
